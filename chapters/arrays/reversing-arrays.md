## Problem

You want to reverse an array.

## Solution

Use JavaScript's Array reverse() method:

{% highlight coffeescript %}
["one", "two", "three"].reverse()
# => ["three", "two", "one"]
{% endhighlight %}

## Discussion

`reverse()` is a standard JavaScript method. Don't forget the parentheses.
